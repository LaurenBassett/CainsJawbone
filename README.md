# The Problem
The 100 Pages of Cain's Jawbone are printed out of order. There are 6 Murderers, 6 Victims, and 1 solution. The task is to determine the order of the pages, the names of the murderers, and who their victims are. 

Only three people have solved the puzzle correctly, and the correct solution has never been published.

This repo has my attempt at solving the puzzle, which I am assuming will take a combination of code and human input. Right now, I am throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks.
